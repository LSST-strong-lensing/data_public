# SL_Hammocks_catalogs

This repository contains mock catalogs of gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae using SL-Hammocks. For more details on SL-Hammocks, please refer to [the official repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SL-Hammocks/tree/main).

## Directory Structure

The `SL_Hammocks_catalogs` directory includes the following four subdirectories:

- `mocks_qso_chab_LSST/`
- `mocks_qso_salp_LSST/`
- `mocks_sn_chab_LSST/`
- `mocks_sn_salp_LSST/`

Each subdirectory contains 10 files named `hoge_log.dat` and `hoge_result.dat` (where `hoge` represents the actual file names).

## File Descriptions

- **`hoge_result.dat`**: Contains the main results of the mock catalogs. For detailed descriptions of the results, please see [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SL-Hammocks/blob/main/result/output.txt).
- **`hoge_log.dat`**: Contains detailed log information of the mock catalogs.

## About SL-Hammocks

These catalogs were generated as part of the LSST DESC SL-Hammocks project. SL-Hammocks is a tool designed to predict the properties of gravitational lensing systems that are expected to be discovered by the LSST. For more details, please visit the [official SL-Hammocks repository](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/SL-Hammocks/tree/main).
